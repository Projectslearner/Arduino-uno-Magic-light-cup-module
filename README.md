# Arduino Uno Magic Light Cup Module

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to control an RGB LED using an Arduino Uno, creating a "magic light cup" effect. The LED changes colors based on the RGB values set in the code. This project is perfect for adding a colorful, interactive element to your Arduino projects.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Uno**
- **RGB LED**
- **Resistors (220Œ© - 1kŒ©)**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**

#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect RGB LED to Arduino Uno:**
   - Connect the red pin of the LED to digital pin 9.
   - Connect the green pin of the LED to digital pin 10.
   - Connect the blue pin of the LED to digital pin 11.
   - Connect a resistor to each LED pin to limit current (220Œ© - 1kŒ©).

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the RGB LED to the Arduino Uno according to the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Observe the RGB LED changing colors (red, green, blue) every second, with RGB values printed to the Serial Monitor.

#### Applications

- **Decorative Lighting:** Enhance projects with dynamic, color-changing lighting.
- **Interactive Displays:** Create visually appealing effects for interactive installations.
- **Educational Projects:** Learn about RGB color mixing and PWM control with LEDs.

#### Notes

- Ensure the RGB LED is correctly oriented and connected to the appropriate pins on the Arduino Uno.
- Adjust the RGB values in the code to create different colors and effects.
- Use resistors to prevent excessive current flow through the LEDs.
